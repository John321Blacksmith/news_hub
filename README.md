This project represents a web application that does collect news from different sources. There is also an accounts system so the user can leave his comments and vote on the news.
The project comes along with a web scraper which performs extraction of the information and updating of the database.
All the scraped data is fetched from the database and rendered on the templates.
Almost all the functionality of the project is covered by tests.
